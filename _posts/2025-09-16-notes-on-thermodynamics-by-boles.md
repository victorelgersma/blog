## Chapter 6

- reversible processes don't actually occur in nature. They are studied for two reasons. The first is that they are quasi-static, meaning they can be modelled as a series of equilibrium states with a well-defined state (with thermodynamic properties whose derivatives are point functions). The second is that work-producing devices produce the most work when they are run on entirely reversible processes (in a so-called "ideal" cycle). 

- examples of irreversibilities:
- 1. friction
- 2. free expansion of a gas
- 3. heat transfer through a finite temperature difference.
