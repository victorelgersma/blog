## Basics

Thermal equilibrium
: a system is in thermal equilibrium if there are no temperature gradients within it. A system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings if $ T_{sys} = T_{surroundings} $.

Process
: A sequence of equilibrium states which connects two states.

Reversible process: 
: A reversible process has $ \Delta S_{universe} = 0 $, implying $\Delta S_{system} = - \Delta
S_{surroundings}$. Any increase in the entropy of the system due to heat transfer is balanced by the decrease in entropy in the surroundings. The process can be reversed without leaving any change in the system or its surroundings. If heat is exchanged $ d Q_{system} = T d S_{system} $. This is often expressed $ d Q_{rev} = T d S $ to emphasize the heat transfer process is reversible. A reversible process is quasi-static, though this is not a sufficient condition (there must also be no irreversibilities which generate entropy)

Second Law
: For an isolated system, $ d S >= 0 $

## Heat engines
Ideal cycle:
: A cycle consists of processes. In an ideal cycle, every process in the cycle is reversible.

Turbine
: drops a fluid's pressure and converts it to rotational mechanical energy

## Rankine Cycle

Subcritical Rankine cycle:
: The working fluid has $p<p_c$ and $T < T_c$ meaning it is a 2-phase mixture. 

Deaerator
: A device which removes gases from liquid water after it comes out of the condenser.
