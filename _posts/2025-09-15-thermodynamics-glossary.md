Thermal equilibrium
: a system is in thermal equilibrium if there are no temperature gradients within it. A system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings if $ T_{sys} = T_{surroundings} $.

Reversible heat transfer: 
: Heat transfer to a system is considered reversible
if $ \Delta S_{universe} = 0 $, implying $\Delta S_{system} = - \Delta
S_{surroundings}$. Any increase in the entropy of the system due to heat transfer is balanced by the decrease in entropy in the surroundings. The process can be reversed without leaving any change in the system or its surroundings.
