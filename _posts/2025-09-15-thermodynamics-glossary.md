## Basics

Thermal equilibrium
: a system is in thermal equilibrium if there are no temperature gradients within it. A system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings if $ T_{sys} = T_{surroundings} $.

Process
: A sequence of equilibrium states which connects two states.


## Heat engines
Ideal cycle:
: A cycle consists of processes. In an ideal cycle, every process in the cycle is reversible.

Turbine
: drops a fluid's pressure and converts it to rotational mechanical energy

## Rankine Cycle

Subcritical Rankine cycle:
: The working fluid has $p<p_c$ and $T < T_c$ meaning it is a 2-phase mixture. 

Deaerator
: A device which removes gases from liquid water after it comes out of the condenser.

## Chapter 6

thermal efficiency (of a heat engine):
The work output divided by the heat input. 

Second Law: Clausius Statement
: No heat engine has a thermal efficiency of 100%

Second Law: Kelvin-Planck Statement:
: You cannot construct a machine whose only effect is to take heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high-temperature reservoir. 

Reversible process: 
: a reversible process is one which can be reversed without leaving any trace on its surroundings. They are useful to analyze because reversible processes are quasi-static (a system goes through a series of equilibrium states in a reversible process)

Second Law
: For an isolated system, $ d S >= 0 $

== Chapter 7

Exergy
: the maximum useful work that could be obtained from a system at a given state. 

Exergy destruction
: Wasted work potential during a process as a result of irreversibilities

Dead state
: a system is in a dead state if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment. A system has zero exergy in a dead state. 

Unavailable energy
: the portion of energy that cannot be converted to work by even a reversible heat engine.
