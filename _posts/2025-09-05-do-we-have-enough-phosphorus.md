At current rates of consumption we have about 300 years to make our food supply
phosphorus free?

## Questions to answer
* What do we use phosphorus for (and how much)
* How much is being exported to the EU
* How about asteroid mining? 
* How about recovery of phosphorus?

## Concerns to address
* You say it is essential for life, but I can name you about 30 compounds that
  are essential for life. Why is phosphorus different?
