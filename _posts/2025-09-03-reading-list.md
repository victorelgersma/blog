Here are some books I would like to read when I get the chance


## Climate and Energy
- _Kim Stanley Robinson: The ministry for the future_
  - a “climate novel” 
- _The story of co2 is the story of everything_
- Without hot air by Mr 
- _More and More and More: an All-Consuming History of Energy_
  - The phrase “energy transition” makes it sound like one fuel has replaced another, but as Fressoz shows, history shows the old sources never really go away. Coal never displaced wood, and oil never displaced coal. New fuels stepped in to power increasingly power-hungry ways of life. 
  - Therefore, the desire to stop consuming fossil fuels to mitigate climate change requires  more than an energy transition. It requires something more akin to an “energy transition”

## Classic Fiction

- The Three Musketeers
- _Blindness_ by José Saramago
