To this date, this is the best explanation of the Law of Conservation of Energy[^1]
that I've come across:

> “There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing natural phenomena that
are known to date. There is no known exception to this law; it is exact,
so far we know. The law is called conservation of energy; it states that
there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in
manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea,
because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical
quantity, which does not change when something happens. It is not a
description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange
fact that we can calculate some number, and when we finish watching
nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the
same.”
