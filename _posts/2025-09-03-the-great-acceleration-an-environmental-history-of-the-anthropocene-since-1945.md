## Outline

### Introduction

- all of human history has taken place in the Holocene (last 11,700 years or so)
- This book introduces the idea of **anthropocene** as a distinct epoch
- This term was coined by Paul Crutzen in 1995
- Factors defining anthropocene:
    - Release of greenhouse gases
    - Massive population growth
Definition: human action becomes the most important factor governing the major biogeochemical cycles:
- major biogeochemical cycles:
    - carbon cycle
    - nitrogen cycle
    - sulfur cycle


### Chapter 1: Energy and Population

- every energy conversion results in the loss of some useful energy
- Human history can be described in 'jumps' in which we discover how to tap into new stores of energy
    - fire (chemical energy store in meat, wood, biomass)
    - agriculture (chemical energy in grass)
    - windmills and water mills (wind, water kinetic energy)
    - we can burn coal now (500 million year's worth of prior photosynthesis)

## Terms

The Great Acceleration - time since 1945 in which humans have shaped the climate by affecting 3 major biogeochemical cycles
