## Outline

### Introduction

- all of human history has taken place in the Holocene (last 11,700 years or so)
- This book introduces the idea of **anthropocene** as a distinct epoch
- This term was coined by Paul Crutzen in 1995
- Factors defining anthropocene:
    - Release of greenhouse gases
    - Massive population growth


### Chapter 1: Energy and Population

- every energy conversion results in the loss of some useful energy
- Human history can be described in 'jumps' in which we discover how to tap into new stores of energy
    - fire (chemical energy store in meat, wood, biomass)
    - agriculture (chemical energy in grass)
    - windmills and water mills (wind, water kinetic energy)
    - we can burn coal now (500 million year's worth of prior photosynthesis)

1945 - present: rest of the world catches up to N. America and Europe when it comes to primary energy consumption. 
Since 1965 the major increases in energy consumption have taken place outside of Europe. 

Coal mining has deleterious environmental (i.e blasting tops of Appalachian mountains) and health effects (i.e due to air pollution)

> But the hike in energy prices of the 197os inspired oil drilling in
new and often challenging environments, including the seafloor, trop-
ical forests, and the Arctic. Leaks, accidents, and blowouts became
more common, thanks to Arctic cold and deep-sea pressures.

## Terms

The Great Acceleration - time since 1945 in which humans have shaped the climate by affecting 3 major biogeochemical cycles

Biota - the full set of living things in an area

Anthropocene: human action becomes the most important factor governing the major biogeochemical cycles

Major biogeochemical cycles: carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, sulfur cycle
