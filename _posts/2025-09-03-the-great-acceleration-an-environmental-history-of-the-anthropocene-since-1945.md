# Engelke & McNeill, The great acceleration - an environmental history since 1945 - Notes

# The authors argue

- the great acceleration should mark the start of the anthropocene
- the anthropocene will continue a long time, but the great acceleration is bound to fizzle out soon 
  - evidence: population growth is already decreasing and we are running out of fossil fuels. 
- social scientists and economists have not seriously grappled with the effect we have had on our environment

## Outline

### Introduction

- The Holocene is the most recent geologic epoch, spanning the last approximately 11,700 years, from the end of the last major ice age to the present day. 
- **Anthropocene** coined by Paul Crtuzen in 1995.
- This term was coined by Paul Crutzen in 1995
- Factors defining anthropocene:
  - Release of greenhouse gases
  - Massive population growth
    Definition: human action becomes the most important factor governing the major _biogeochemical cycles_:

### Chapter 1: Energy and Population

- every energy technology results in the loss of some useful energy
- Technologies increased the amount of energy we could harvest:  (we could tap into more and more high-quality energy sources)
  - fire 
  - agriculture 
  - windmills and water mills

### Conclusion

- the anthropocene is a period in earth history, not necessarily in human history.
- the authors prefer a start date of the anthropocene around the middle of the 20th century. 
- it is possible to define it earlier than 1945, but the authors prefer 1945 because the graphs of human activity lurch upwards around the middle of the 20th century. 
- only after 1945 did human factors genuinely become the main drivers forces behind crucial earth systems. 
- after 1945 the human impact on the biosphere really ramped up
  - evidence: dam building, city growth, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification...

### Questions

What is the difference between the anthropocene and the great acceleration?
Anthropocene can last (our effects will outlive us even if we emigrate to another planet). On the other hand the Great Acceleration cannot continue

### Terms

**The Great Acceleration**- time since 1945 in which humans have shaped the climate by affecting 3 major biogeochemical cycles
**Biota** - the full set of living things in an area
