title: Turbines extract work primarily from enthalpy, not kinetic energy of steam

A turbine increases the pressure of a gas and extracts work from it. For most turbines, the power is generated from the specific enthalpy drop rather than the change in velocity. 

Even though the steady-flow energy balance equation contains many terms, the following is generally true:
$$
\Delta h >> \Delta(KE)
$$

Consider some typical values for a (superheated steam) turbine:

$\Delta h = 1000kJ/kg$
$v=50m/s$
$P=20MW$

note that specific enthalpy actual has the same dimensionality as the square of velocity, i.e 

$$
kJ/kg = 1000 J/kg = 1000 m^2/s^2
$$

the specific KE of the incoming velocity is:

$$
1/2 \times v^2 = 1/2\times (50 m/s)^2 \approx 1000 m^2/s^2 = 1000 J/kg = 1 kJ/kg << \Delta h
$$
