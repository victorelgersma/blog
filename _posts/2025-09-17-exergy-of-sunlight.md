The exergy of sunlight is the maximum amount of **work potential** that could be
extracted by a reversible heat engine if it were somehow connected to the Sun.  

If we imagine a Carnot engine where the high-temperature heat reservoir is at
the surface of the Sun, \(T_\text{sun} \approx 5800~\mathrm{K}\), and the
low-temperature reservoir is at ambient Earth temperature, \(T_\text{earth} \approx 300~\mathrm{K}\),  
and let the solar power incident on the surface of the Earth be
\(\phi = 0.95~\mathrm{kW/m^2}\), then the **maximum work potential** is:

\[
\dot{W}_\text{max} = \eta_\text{Carnot} \, \phi
                     = \left( 1 - \frac{T_\text{earth}}{T_\text{sun}} \right) \phi
                     \approx (1 - \frac{300}{5800}) \cdot 0.95~\mathrm{kW/m^2} 
                     \approx 0.90~\mathrm{kW/m^2}
\]

The intuition is that sunlight is “high-quality” energy because
\(T_\text{sun} \gg T_\text{earth}\), so a very large fraction of the incoming
solar energy can, in principle, be converted to work.
